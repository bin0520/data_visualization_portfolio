## 📬 A little About Me

I am a six-year PhD student in Sociology.
My visualizations often explore themes of social inequality, adolescent behavior, and educational outcomes. 
In most of my research, I deal with AddHealth data. 
But in the past school projects, I also had experience using Census, ACS data, and GSS data.
